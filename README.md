### Health check
This project uses Spring actuator in order to implement health check which can be accessed at [http://localhost:8080/health](http://localhost:8080/health).

## Tips
By default, the API is configured to upload files with a maximum of 300 MB and, if is a chunked transfer, with a maximum of 1MB per chunk.
This can be changed in the application.properties file:
```
upload.max.file.size.bytes=300000000
upload.max.chunk.size.bytes=1000000
```

Depending on the size of the uploaded file it may be required to increase the JVM heap size. For instance:
```
mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.jvmArguments="-Xmx6144m"
```
